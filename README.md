Sure! Here's a professional and structured `README.md` text for your **ExpenseTracker** project, tailored to your current architecture and goals:

---

# 📊 ExpenseTracker

**ExpenseTracker** is a financial data extraction and visualization system that automatically processes transaction notification emails from multiple financial institutions, stores them in a structured database, and presents meaningful insights through a dynamic dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📥 **Automated Email Extraction**
  Extracts transaction data (amount, merchant, date, card type, description) from various banks’ email notifications.

* 🧠 **Smart Bank Identification**
  Uses sender and keyword matching to route emails to the appropriate regex-based parsing logic defined in `config.yml`.

* 🧾 **Duplicate-Aware Insertion**
  Inserts all transactions, even similar ones, while flagging potential duplicates for manual review.

* 🗂 **Advanced Categorization & Tagging**
  Categorize and tag transactions for flexible filtering and deep financial analysis.

* 📊 **Interactive Dashboard (React)**
  Visualize expenses by category, month, or tag with expandable Recharts components and responsive design.

* 🧪 **Modular Architecture**
  Easily add new banks, regex patterns, or email templates without modifying core logic.
